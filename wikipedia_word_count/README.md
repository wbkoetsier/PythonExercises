# Wikipedia word count

## Introduction
This is an assignment I was given for a job application. The goal is simple: what is the top 10 most used words on some
(randomly chosen) Wikipedia pages? Performance should be optimal.

## Aproach
Based on the existing first version (word-count) I'll implement an async version using TDD.

## Requirements
Python 3.6
